# Social Value

As the world progresses, the oil industry faces increasing environmental pressures, affecting the reputation and long-term value of companies. Although rooted in the oil industry, Mo is committed to becoming an innovative technology company in the Web 3.0 space, improving the living environment for humanity. To reflect Mo's social value, the Mo team will allocate a portion of the oilfield profits to establish two foundations:

**8.1 Social Charity Foundation**

* **Mo Global Charity Foundation**: This foundation is dedicated to education, environmental protection, and medical aid, primarily focused on local oilfield communities. It aims to alleviate the environmental pressure faced by the oil industry and collaborate with international organizations (such as the United Nations) to enhance the global reputation of the Mo project.

**8.2 Community Co-Governance Foundation**

* **Mo Co-Governance Foundation**: This foundation will incubate the Web 3.0 community, fostering community consensus and governance mechanisms to build the Mo digital metaverse. The foundation’s operations include:
  * **Team Expansion**: Utilizing funds to continually expand the team, attracting top global talent to enhance professional expertise and innovation.
  * **Establishment of Research Institutes**: Funds will be used to establish various research institutes, continually recruiting experts and scholars in various fields to drive cutting-edge technology and application research, improving the overall technological level of the Mo ecosystem.
  * **Ecosystem Development**: Investing in ecosystem expansion and development to build a robust digital ecosystem, providing a good environment and opportunities for participants, creating a win-win situation.
  * **Mo Land Digital Metaverse**: Building the Mo metaverse ecosystem, which includes areas such as land, commerce, entertainment, and entrepreneurial incentives.

**Source of Foundation Funding**: With the DOA oilfield’s profit-sharing cycle lasting 25-50 years, the underlying assets of the Mo project ensure the sustainable operation of the foundation. The Charity Foundation strengthens Mo's brand value, while the Co-Governance Foundation promotes the consensus foundation and governance model of the Web 3.0 community, ensuring the healthy development of the Mo ecosystem.
