# Risks and Challenges

The Mo project is positioned at the intersection of the oil industry and the digital industry, enjoying the benefits of compound growth while also facing dual risks from both sectors.

**9.1 Comprehensive Risk Management System**

To safeguard investors' funds, the Mo project has established a comprehensive risk management system, including:

* **Policy and Legal Risk Prevention**: Collaborating with globally licensed exchanges to ensure compliant token issuance.
* **Asset Security Protection**: Core assets are secured through smart contracts to protect investor rights; the DOA company's board resolution ensures exclusive issuance rights for the digital currency, and multiple layers of oversight ensure fund security.
* **Market Risk Management**: Utilizing IoT for real-time monitoring of oil well operations to reduce operational costs, improve efficiency, and respond to market changes; the project team and partners include experienced investment experts who provide professional financial support, reducing market risk.
* **Operational Risk Control**: Joint oversight by the government of Chad, exchanges, and the issuing team.
* **Geopolitical Risk Mitigation**: Diversifying political risks through multiple international projects.
* **Technology and Security Risk Response**: A top-tier technical team continually optimizes system security.
* **Moral Hazard Prevention**: The founding team’s interests are deeply tied to the long-term success of the project.
* **Force Majeure Risk Response**: Partnering with globally renowned reinsurance companies to reinsure oilfield assets, increasing the project's resilience to geopolitical and other uncontrollable risks, further securing Mo’s underlying assets.

**9.2 Three-Layer Compliance Protection System**

The regulatory landscape for the digital industry and related legal provisions are continuously evolving, potentially posing long-term legal risks for the project. To ensure long-term stable development, the Mo project has established a three-layer compliance protection system:

* **Internal Risk Control**: Establishing a strong internal risk control and legal team to conduct internal risk and compliance assessments on the project’s development, and to stay updated on changes in the digital industry, adjusting the project’s compliance direction as needed.
* **External Advisory Teams and Law Firms**: Partnering with legal advisory teams from different countries to ensure the project operates compliantly in each jurisdiction.
* **Community Self-Governance Mechanism**: Through the Mo community self-governance mechanism, providing compliance training for community members, raising overall compliance awareness, accepting community supervision, and obtaining timely feedback to prevent potential risks.

**Compliance Strategy**: Based on the three-layer compliance protection system, the Mo project team continuously optimizes its compliance strategy, updating it quarterly to adapt to global regulatory changes, and regularly releasing compliance reports subject to market oversight.

Despite the comprehensive risk management system and three-layer compliance protection system, the Mo project may face unforeseen difficulties and challenges during its operation. For this reason, the Mo team will continue to refine, optimize, and strengthen risk control and compliance measures, build a global expert advisory team, and leverage Mo’s community self-governance to reduce information gaps for investors, maximizing the security of investors' funds.
