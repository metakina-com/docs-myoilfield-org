# Business System

The Mo project not only demonstrates innovation in technology and business models but also ensures comprehensiveness and sustainability through its business system design. The following outlines the detailed structure of Mo’s business system:

**5.1 Core Concepts and Terminology**

* **Mo.w-DOA**: Refers to the oil wells in the DOA oilfield, numbered Mo.w-DOA001 to Mo.w-DOA350, with each oil well corresponding to a millionth of a digital oil well share.
* **Mo.t**: Represents "My Oiltank" (Metaverse Oiltank), where 1 international standard barrel (Brent, WTI, NYSE) = 10,000 Mo.t. The oil quality varies between oilfields, as do trading prices, such as Mo.t-ChadDOA.

* **Mo Game (Mo.G)**: The Mo platform's game module (including blockchain games and mobile games), which provides long-term incentives to players through profit-sharing and Mo Coin airdrops (with a token economy model including inflation, deflation, or stablecoin mechanisms).
* **Mo Land (Mo.L)**: The Web3 land on the Mo platform, available for users to purchase and develop, contributing to the creation of the digital metaverse.

**5.2 Business Process**

The Mo project’s business process is designed to be simple and efficient, ensuring that users can easily participate and earn returns. The specific process is as follows:

1. **Users access the main chain via DApp and join the project**: Users access the Mo platform through a decentralized application (DApp) to learn project details and start investing.
2. **Activate Mo Wallet**: Users must activate their Mo Wallet, including both centralized and decentralized wallets, to ensure secure storage and management of their assets.
3. **Deposit and purchase Mo.w (digital oil wells)**: Users deposit funds into their Mo Wallet and purchase Mo.w (Mo Web 3 oil wells) to start investing.
4. **Mo Wallet pumps the corresponding output oil Mo.t daily into investors' accounts**: Based on the number of oil wells invested in, Mo Wallet pumps the corresponding output oil Mo.t into users’ digital wallets daily.
5. **Investors withdraw or transfer**: Users can withdraw or transfer their assets through decentralized exchanges (DEX) or third-party trading companies, ensuring asset liquidity and realization. Third-party services ensure smooth transactions.

**5.3 Branding and Marketing Strategy**
