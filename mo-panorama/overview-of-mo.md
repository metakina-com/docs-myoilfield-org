# Overview of MO

The world is currently at an unprecedented turning point. Web 3.0 not only brings technological innovation but also completely reconstructs business models and ways of creating wealth. In this wave of digital transformation, cutting-edge technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) are working together, profoundly transforming every aspect of our lives. The traditional heavy-asset, centralized investment model of the oil industry is also set to face major challenges.

**The Mo Project** (hereinafter referred to as **Mo**) stands at the intersection of traditional energy and the digital future. Through innovative blockchain technology, it aims to democratize oil investment, creating unprecedented wealth opportunities and reshaping the global energy market. Mo is not only conducting a digital transformation of oil investment but also redefining the entire paradigm of energy investment.

* **Mission**: To achieve decentralized and transparent oil investment using Web 3.0 decentralized technology.
* **Vision**: To enable every household to own its own digital oil field!

**2.1 Mo’s Core Advantages: Trillion-Dollar Oilfield Resources**

Mo redefines oil investment from a groundbreaking perspective, adopting an innovative asset securitization model that transforms the Chad DOA oilfield block, a resource with immense wealth potential, into a digital oil well that everyone can participate in. Specific advantages include:

* **Cooperation Agreement**: The Mo project has signed a 25-year commercial development contract with the government of Chad, extendable to 43 years.
* **Oil Well Development**: Over the next three years, the development of 350 oil wells will gradually be completed, covering 2,035 square kilometers, equivalent to nearly 300,000 soccer fields.
* **Producible Reserves**: According to data from multiple international assessment companies, the Chad DOA oilfield block has producible reserves of about 750 million to 2.5 billion barrels, enough to meet the world’s oil consumption for 3 to 10 days.
* **Production Capacity and Returns**: The first oil well produces 500 tons per day (about 3,650 barrels), with an annual output value of approximately $100 million (at $80 per barrel). The total value of crude oil production rights for the 350 oil wells over the next 25 years is estimated at $500 to $2,000 billion.
* **Global Expansion**: In addition to the Chad oilfield, the Mo project team is in deep contact with project stakeholders from oil-producing countries such as Kazakhstan, Malaysia, and Dubai. The team plans to expand coverage to multiple major oil-producing countries within the next five years, establishing a globally leading Web 3.0 digital oil rights investment platform.

**2.2 Mo’s Business Model: Digital Oil Wells Accessible to All**

The Mo project, anchored by the trillion-dollar crude oil production rights of the Chad DOA oilfield block, pioneered the “Blockchain + Oil” model. Specific features include:

* **Digital Oil Well Issuance**: Each oil well issues 10 million shares, totaling 3.5 billion shares of digital oil wells. Each share can receive a proportional dividend from the oil production of that well.
* **Investment Threshold**: The initial offering price is 2 USDT per share, far lower than the high thresholds of traditional oil investment.
* **Dividend Distribution**: Dividends are paid in USDT on time to investors' digital wallets, with low transfer fees and high transfer efficiency, ensuring the timeliness and security of profit sharing.
* **Technical Support**: IoT technology enables real-time sharing of operational data to ensure fairness and transparency in profit sharing. Blockchain-based digital wallets guarantee ownership, and every transaction and every drop of oil can be traced on the blockchain.
* **Management Service Fee**: The project party provides technical support, system maintenance, oilfield operations, and supply chain integration services, with an annual extraction of no less than 1% of crude oil production rights as a management service fee.

**2.3 Mo’s Commercial Value: The Mo Economic Ecosystem**

The Mo project not only brings substantial returns to investors but also introduces the oil industry to Web 3.0, creating additional commercial value and growth potential. Potential application scenarios include:

1. **Payment Function**: Investors can use digital oil wells to purchase, transfer, and trade oil assets, enjoying efficient transactions and low fees.
2. **Digital Asset Trading Platform**: In the future, Mo plans to build a digital asset trading platform to tokenize oil assets, increasing liquidity and transaction transparency. Trading fees and transfer fees from the platform will generate additional profits for the company.
3. **DeFi Features**: Using smart contracts, digital oil well users can lend or invest in digital oil assets to earn additional returns.
4. **Value Spillover**: The digital oil well payment function can extend to industries surrounding oil, such as gas stations and supermarkets, expanding the application of the Mo project in daily life, forming a business loop.
5. **Mo Token Economic Ecosystem**: Based on the Ethereum ERC-20 standard, Mo Coin is an RWA (Real World Asset) token anchored by the project’s oil resources. Mo Coin, pegged to oil, has the potential to lead a new track in the digital asset industry and is perfectly integrated into the aforementioned application scenarios, forming a complete token economic ecosystem and building the Mo metaverse.

**Conclusion**: In the future, the Mo project has the potential to achieve oil payments, oil trading, and oil asset reinvestment, building a complete Mo economic ecosystem and making the concept of digital oil wells accessible to households worldwide. The Mo project not only focuses on the oil industry but also goes beyond traditional industries by empowering Web 3.0 and benefiting from the high valuations of emerging industries.
